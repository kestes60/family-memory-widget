Build a lightweight, embeddable JS widget for genealogy sites: A simple mic button records up to 5min audio (using browser MediaRecorder API, convert to WAV blob). Send as multipart formData (append 'file' with WAV blob) via POST to my Railway Faster Whisper API at https://faster-whisper-api-production-537b.up.railway.app/transcribe-audio (returns JSON like {"transcript": "...", "language": "en", "language_probability": 0.95}). During recording, show a shrinking progress bar (horizontal, starts full green, depletes to empty red like a countdown timer, with numeric "X:XX left" overlay; free limit 2min). Display editable transcript + language/confidence in a clean modal. Free: Up to 2min + basic share. Pro hint: $5 upgrade for unlimited time, photo upload (append 'photo' to formData), PDF export (with timestamps/photo). Add rate-limiting (3 free uses/IP per day via localStorage). Output: Single <script src="widget.js"></script> tag for embed + sample index.html. Vanilla JS only. Include Stripe checkout link for pro unlock.
